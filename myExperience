#My experience and further notes

I started using the Sandbox and I ...
Installing the Sandbox was a long process of trial and error.
Initially, I tried to use virtual box since I had experience with the program beforehand.

Since I had no previous experience with any of the variables, I had to spend some time getting familiar. This included understanding that scala is a language used by spark.
As a result, I downloaded spark, scala and sbt using brew. In order to install Spark, I also had to install java through my terminal. Afterwards, I researched different ways of implementing spark on my computer

I liked doing T...
